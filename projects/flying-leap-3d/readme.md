Developing guidance control code that uses the Leap device for user input.


## Live Demos

Live Demo #5: [FGx Plane Spotter ~ Leap]( http://jaanga.github.io/gestification/projects/flying-leap-3d/fgx-plane-spotter-leap/latest.html )


Live Demo #4: [unFlatland ~ Leap]( http://jaanga.github.io/gestification/projects/flying-leap-3d/un-flatland-leap/latest.html )


Live Demo #3: [Barfolina Pavillion](http://jaanga.github.io/gestification/projects/flying-leap-3d/barfolina-pavillion/r3/barfolina-pavillion.html)

- Worth a visit
- The entire pavilion - except for the sculpture - is created by procedures. This is the modern way of designing - which we are calling 'archieCode'.

Live Demo #2: [Castle](http://jaanga.github.io/gestification/projects/flying-leap-3d/castle/load-castle.html)

- A test of loading an OBJ file into Three.js. 
- Note the castle - which is the static OBJ file - also refreshes its colors with each reload. 

Live Demo #1: [Flying Leap 3D](http://jaanga.github.io/gestification/projects/flying-leap-3d/r1/flying-leap-3d.html )

- The landscape along with the placement of the trees is controlled by an algebraic function. Note the refresh of colors with each reload.


Built for Nicolás Berríos of Iquique, Chile

The proposal is to build an app for the Leap Motion device that allows you to 'fly' over [Iquique harbor](http://goo.gl/Tq4F59). 
But how to fly using just one hand? These demos are testing grounds for learning how to fly 
- and, more importantly, for us to learn good ways of teaching people how to fly. 

Other things we are working on an updated First Person camera controller for Three.js.

Leap.js + Three.js: a Leaped first person camera controller

###Demos: Status and Issues

See the readme in each demo's folder for more details and status of issues

## Leap Actions

Hand open over Leap device:

* Supports the following FirstPersonControls parameters: moveLeft, moveRight, moveUp, moveUp, moveForward, moveBackword 
* Supports pitch and yaw via Three.js lat and lon parameters
* Making fist restricts camera movement to lat and lon only
* Supports Freeze all interaction toggle via a swipe gesture.

###New First Person Control Mouse Actions

* The fork supports all the standard Three.js First Person Control functions
* The fork supports the following additions:
* Turning the scroll wheel controls the speed of movementSpeed and lookSpeed << This feature is wonderful. Try it!
* When a mouse button is not being pressed the scroll wheel updates lookSpeed.
* When a mouse button is being pressed, the scroll wheel updates movementSpeed
* Clicking the scroll wheel toggles Freeze on and off.

### New First Person Control  Keyboard Commands

	The following new keyboard commands are added to the fork:
	
	````
	switch ( event.keyCode ) {
	case 32: /*spacebar*/ this.freeze = !this.freeze; break;
	
	case 33: /*page up*/ this.moveUp = true; break;
	case 34: /*page down*/ this.moveDown = true; break;
	
	case 36: /*home*/ this.lookSpeed = 0; this.lat += 1.0; break;
	case 35: /*end*/ this.lookSpeed = 0; this.lat -= 1.0; break;	

	case 188: /*< or ,*/ this.lookSpeed = 0; this.lon -= 0.5; break;
	case 190: /*> or .*/ this.lookSpeed = 0; this.lon += 0.5; break;	
	
	
	````
